## Obligatory Intro

Hello fellow humans, you have stumbled upon my passion project, Py Music Downloader!  

I have written this program to basically download songs from YouTube and Spotify. 

Basically you can now pirate music.



## Why did I release it?

I have nothing better to do with my life  Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯



# Nerd Stuff



## What Libraries I Used?

* pafy
* youtube-dl
* spotipy
* mutagen
* requests



That's about it (Haven't included the standard libraries, just hunt for them in the spaghetti code ðŸ˜…)



### Please star the repo and feel free to use my spaghetti code I won't mind (don't come after me when it doesn't work). Feedback is much appreciated ðŸ˜ƒ

### Peace, âœŒ
